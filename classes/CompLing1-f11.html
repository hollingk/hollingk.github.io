      <P>This is the first semester in our two-semester graduate
      sequence in computational linguistics. During this semester, we
      will focus on fundamental methods, algorithms, and data
      structures in natural language processing. Topics include:
      finite-state methods, context-free and extended context-free
      models of syntax; parsing and semantic interpretation; n-gram
      and Hidden Markov models, part-of-speech tagging; and
      natural language applications. Students completing this course
      will have a solid working knowledge of the basics of NLP and
      will be well prepared for the second semester course, which
      covers natural language processing with a focus on corpus-based
      statistical techniques.
      <P>This class fulfills the AI Area of the Computer
      Science <a
      href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/Grad/policy-manual.shtml">MS 
      Comps</a> requirements. 
      <P><b>Prerequisites</b>: There will be a fair amount of
      programming required to complete the homeworks for this course,
      and therefore some programming experience is assumed. There is
      no official programming language for this course, but I strongly
      recommend using <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> and
      the <a href="http://www.nltk.org/">NLTK toolkit</a> --
      <em>particularly</em> if you are planning to continue on to
      Computational Linguistics 2 next semester -- unless you have a
      strong preference otherwise. You are expected to have a computer
      on which you can complete the homework assignments.

      <P><b>Attendance</b>
      <ul>
	<li>Students who miss up to two classes for a medical reason must
      make a reasonable effort to contact me in advance, and bring a
      self-signed note upon return to class, acknowledging that the
      information provided is accurate. Subsequent absences will
      require medical documentation.
	<li>Prolonged absences due to illness
      (multiple consecutive absences) require written documentation
      from a health care provider.
	<li>Absence from either of the
      <b>exams</b> due to illness also requires documentation from a
      health care professional, as well as notifying me in advance
      when possible.
      <li>If you know you will miss class due to religious
      observances, please notify me <em>in advance</em>, within the
      first two weeks of class.
	</ul>
      <P><b>Homeworks</b>
      <ul>
	<li>Homeworks must be completed individually.
	<li>Plaigiarism will not be tolerated, and will result in a
      0. However, discussing class concepts amongst your classmates is
      recommended and encouraged; generally, you can discuss concepts
      and pseudo-code, but do not share actual code. Please visit the <a
      href="http://www.shc.umd.edu/">Student Honor Council</a> website
      for more information on the consequences of cheating, fabrication,
      facilitation, and plagiarism.
      </ul>
      <P><b>Late and Incomplete Work</b>
      <ul>
	<li>Assigments are due at the beginning of class, typically by
      e-mail to me and the TA unless otherwise noted.
	<li>Homeworks
      that are late will still be graded if handed in within 48 hours
      of the deadline, but your score will automatically be
      halved. Exceptions can be discussed in the case of medical or
      family emergencies, but will only be considered <em>prior</em>
      to the homework deadline. After 48 hours, homeworks will no
      longer be accepted.
	<li>I am unable to issue an 'Incomplete' grade. If an
      emergency arises, discuss with me as soon as possible and we
      will have to go to the department together.
      </ul>
      <P><b>Exams</b>
      <ul>
	<li>Exams will be in-class and open-book/open-note/open-laptop
      (but not open-internet).
      </ul>
      <P><b>Students with Disabilities</b>
      <ul><li>The campus's <a
      href="http://www.counseling.umd.edu/DSS/">Disability Support
      Service Office</a> (DSS) works with students and faculty to
      address a variety of issues ranging from test anxiety to
      physical and psychological disabilities. To receive
      accommodations, students must first have their disabilities
      documented by DSS. The office then prepares an Accommodation
      Letter for course instructors regarding needed accommodations,
      which needs to be presented to me, the instructor, at the
      beginning of the semester (within the first three class
      sessions).</ul>
      <P><b>Class Cancellations</b>
      <ul>
	<li>Official closures and delays are announced on the <a
      href="http://umd.edu">campus website</a> and the snow
      phone line (301-405-SNOW), as well as on local radio and TV
      stations. Information about possible rescheduling of course
      activities will be provided via e-mail and on this website once
      the campus has re-opened.
	<li>If I am forced to cancel a class even though the
      University is open, due to inclement weather or illness, I will
      notify the class via e-mail (and on this website).
