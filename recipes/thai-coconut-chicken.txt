Thai Curry, Paleo Style

A sweet and salty "soup" made Paleo diet friendly.

Prep Time: 10 minutes
Cooking Time: 35 minutes
Serves: 8
Yield 1.5 cups


Ingredients

- 16 oz chicken, raw
- 12(ish) oz Cream of Coconut
- 1 cup orange bell pepper
- other veggies; have used zucchini, and cauliflower
- 1 yield Lime Juice Raw
- 8 tbsp Basil, Fresh
- some 100% Pure Maple Syrup (calls for 1/4 cup)
- (calls for 1/4 cup Vietnamese Fish Sauce; I've never used)
- 2 tbsp Red Curry Paste (I've used random curry powder -- sweet curry is too sweet)

Directions

Mix 2 tablespoons of thai curry paste with 2 tablespoons of coconut cream in a wok 
over medium high heat. Stir until very fragrant, then add cut up pieces of chicken 
meat. Stir until cooked, about 5 minutes. Add the veggies with half of the fresh 
basil, and all of the bamboo shoots and sliced bell pepper. If additional heat is 
desired, add 1 to 3 Thai chili peppers, sliced. Let simmer for 20-25 min until the 
pepper starts to soften. Add maple syrup and lime juice in small amounts to adjust 
the flavors of the soup until you have a good balance of spicy, salty and sweet.
