Mock Cornbread and Beef Casserole (South Beach Diet Online, Phase I)
Serves 6

1 15.5-oz can Great Northern beans (drained & rinsed)
4 large eggs
1/3 cup Splenda
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 tsp tabasco

Combine all of the above and blend in a blender. Pour half of the mixture 
into a greased 11x7 pan and bake in a preheated 400° oven for 15 minutes, 
then reduce heat to 350°. Meanwhile combine meat mixture. 

Meat Mixture: 
1 lb cooked lean ground beef (drained)
1 10-oz can diced tomatoes (drained)
2 Tbsp diced canned jalapeños
1 tsp cumin
2 Tbsp chili powder
1 tsp garlic salt
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

1 cup low fat cheese

Mix all ingredients together.

Remove mock cornbread from oven and sprinkle with 1/3 cup cheese. Top with 
the meat mixture and sprinkle with another 1/3 cup cheese. Pour the rest of 
the bean batter on top of the meat mixture and top with 1/3 cup cheese. Bake 
casserole for about 35 minutes (until mock cornbread is cooked through and 
has turned a golden brown). 

Serve with a dollop of fat free sour cream.
