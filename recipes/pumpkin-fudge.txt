Pumpkin Fudge

made 10/16/10

Ingredients:
*  2 cups sugar
*  1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
*  3/4 cup butter
*  2/3 cup (6 oz) evaporated milk
*  1/2 cup canned pumpkin
*  1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
*  1 (12 oz) package white chocolate chips
*  1 (7 oz) jar marshmallw creme -- I used 1 cup of mini marshmallows instead
*  1 cup chopped pecans -- none for me
*  1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract -- oops, forgot!

Instructions:

1. In a heavy saucepan, combine the first 6 ingredients; heat over medium 
   heat until sugar dissolves, stirring frequently.
2. Continue heating until mixture begins to boil, stirring constantly. Cook 
   over medium heat until mixture has risen high in the pan and then come 
   down, about 8 minutes. Drop a little bit of the mixture into a small 
   saucer of cold water. If it forms a ball, it is ready for the next step. 
   Or, use a candy thermometer to check mixture for doneness; the thermometer 
   should read 232 degrees.
3. Remove pan from heat; stir in chocolate chips until melted. Add in 
   remaining ingredients; stir to mix well. Pour into a buttered 13x9 inch 
   baking pan; cool to room temperature.
4. Cut into square; store in the refrigerator in an air-tight container.
5. Makes about 5 dozen squares.
