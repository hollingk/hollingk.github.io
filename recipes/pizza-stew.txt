Pizza Chicken 
from “500 Low-Carb Recipes” by Dana Carpender

2-3 boneless chicken breasts (recipe called for chicken quarters, but breasts are lots easier)
1-2 T. olive oil
8 oz tomato sauce
4 oz mushrooms, drained (I don’t think this is essential, for the mushroom-phobes in the audience!)
1/2 c. dry red wine
1 green pepper, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
1-2 cloves garlic, crushed
1-1 ½ tsp dried oregano
3 oz shredded mozzarella cheese (or cut string cheese into rounds)
Parmesan cheese (optional)

1. Warm the olive oil in a big, heavy skillet, and brown the chicken in it 
over medium heat (we cut the chicken into chunks to make more of a stew, but 
can keep the chicken breasts whole).

2. Pour in tomato sauce, mushroom, and wine. Add green pepper, onion, garlic, 
and oregano. Cover the whole thing, turn the burner to its lowest setting, and 
forget about it for 45 minutes to 1 hour.

3. Spoon into microwave safe serving bowls, then put mozzarella cheese on top and 
microwave 20-30 seconds on 50% power to melt the cheese. May also want to sprinkle 
Parmesan cheese on top after taking out of microwave. (If you’re taking this to 
work, take 1-2 string cheese sticks with it for the mozzarella.)
