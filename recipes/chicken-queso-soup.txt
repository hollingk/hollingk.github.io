Chicken Queso Soup
 
from bharris on www.southbeach-diet-plan.com
 
Ingredients:
1/2 large onion, chopped
3 T butter
2 sm cans chopped green chiles
2 cans diced tomatoes
1 8 oz package of FF cream cheese
1 can chicken broth
1 1/2 cups of FF half and half
4 t lemon juice
Garlic powder, cumin, cayenne pepper and salt to taste (start with 2 teaspoons and adjust accordingly ... this amount does make it spicy.)
1-2 cups chopped, cooked chicken. (or just however much you have left over. original recipe claims that it's good without the chicken, I haven't tried it that way.)
1 bunch chopped green onions (the white part)
1 bunch chopped cilantro
 
1. Melt butter over med. high heat. Saute onion in butter until translucent.
2. Add green chiles and tomatoes (do not drain either one) and cook, stirring constantly, until about half of the liquid is evaporated.
3. Add cream cheese and cook until melted, stirring constantly.
4. Add broth, half & half, lemon juice and seasonings. (original recipe calls for you to puree the soup with an immersion blender, but that's optional --  says it's good either way, and I don't do the puree, I like my soups chunky.)
5. Add chopped chicken and heat until warmed through. Do not boil.
6. Serve, garnishing each portion with chopped green onions and chopped cilantro.
 
In my opinion, the green onions in the garnish is a must for this soup. Gives it a "crunchy kick."
 
Sadly, this does not freeze well.
