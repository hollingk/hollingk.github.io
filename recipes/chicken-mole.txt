Chicken Mole (South Beach Diet Cookbook, Phase I)
Serves 2

1 1/4 pounds chicken breast tenders
1/2 large onion, chopped 
1/2 large green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 cloves garlic, minced 
1 tablespoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 can (7 1/4 oz) diced tomatoes 
1 tablespoon unsweetened natural peanut butter
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder 
1 scallion, chopped 	

Sprinkle the chicken with salt and black pepper. Heat a large nonstick 
skillet coated with olive oil cooking spray over medium-high heat. Add 
the chicken and cook for 8 minutes, turning once, or until browned on 
both sides. Remove the chicken to a large plate.

Add the onion, bell pepper, and garlic to the skillet and cook for 3 
minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent. Stir in the chili powder, 
cinnamon, and cloves and cook for 1 minute. Return the chicken to the 
skillet. Add the tomatoes (with juice), peanut butter, and cocoa powder 
and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer, stirring every few minutes, for 25 
minutes, turning once, or until the chicken is no longer pink. Garnish 
with the scallions.
