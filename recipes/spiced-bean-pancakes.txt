Spiced Bean Pancakes (Phase I)
Serves 4 (16 pancakes)

1 15-oz can Great Northern or Garbanzo beans, drained & rinsed 
4 large eggs (1 cup fake eggs)
3/4 c Splenda
1/4 tsp baking soda + 1/4 c nonfat dry milk to help the rise
2 tsp baking powder 
2 Tbsp oil 
1 tsp vanilla
3 Tbsp pumpkin pie spice
1 tsp butter extract (optional)
1/4 c toasted chopped walnuts (optional) 

Mix all of ingredients in a blender. Beat the bejeezus out of it! Pour 
mixture onto a heated no-stick griddle or skillet (325ยบ) sprayed with 
Pam. Flip them over when pancakes "bubble" on top, just like regular 
pancakes. 

Make 3 to 4 inch pancakes.

Can also make a cake by pouring into 8 x 8 baking pan. Bake at 350ยบ 
until toothpick inserted in center pulls out clean (approximately 30 min).
