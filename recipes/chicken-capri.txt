Chicken Capri (South Beach Diet Cookbook, Phase I)
Serves 4

1 cup reduced-fat ricotta cheese
1 cup crushed tomatoes
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
1/2 tsp garlic powder
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves	
2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil	
4 slices reduced-fat mozzarella cheese	

Rub the chicken with the garlic powder. Heat the oil in a large skillet 
over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 1-2 minutes per side. 
Place the chicken breasts, side by side, in a large baking dish and allow 
to cool. Preheat the oven to 350°F.

In a blender or food processor, combine the ricotta with the oregano, salt, 
and pepper. Process to blend. Spoon 1/4 cup of the cheese mixture and 1/4 
cup tomatoes onto each chicken breast. Top each chicken breast with 1 slice 
mozzarella. Bake for 20 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the 
thickest portion of a breast registers 170°F and the juices run clear.
