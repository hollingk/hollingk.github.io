Sweet & Spicy Red Soup
 
Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup onion, diced
1 stalk celery, sliced
2 medium red bell peppers, seeded and chopped
Pinch of cayenne pepper (if you like it spicy, use more â€“ I sprinkle the pot generously)
1 tablespoon grated ginger root (I use the kind in the jar)
1 large can (28 ounces) plum tomatoes, chopped (with juices)
3 cups chicken broth
1/3 cups granular Splenda
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
Salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
 
Directions:
 
In a large saucepan over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion, celery and peppers; cook until softened but not browned. Add cayenne and ginger; cook one minute. Add undrained tomatoes, broth, Splenda and vinegar.
 
Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, 25 minutes, to reduce slightly. Remove from heat.
 
The recipe says to cool slightly then puree in blender or food processor until smooth, but I like my soups a little chunky. So, I don't do this step.
 
This freezes well.
